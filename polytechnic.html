    <h2>What is a Polytechnic Course?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;"> A polytechnic course is a progressive learning experience that allows students to participate in a diploma or vocational course based on technical education. These courses provide a viable alternative to degree programmes, and students may pursue them after completing their secondary education. Polytechnic courses focus on developing skills and practical experience rather than theoretical knowledge. Upon completion, students receive a diploma that typically qualifies them to apply for jobs in their desired field.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Polytechnic Course Subject Areas</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Government-owned and privately owned polytechnic schools provide a variety of course options. In general, the courses may provide students with a diploma in a technical area, such as engineering, or a diploma in a non-technical domain, such as the arts and sciences. Many schools continue to provide more polytechnic course options to pursue.
